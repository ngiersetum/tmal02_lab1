%CHECKISAFUNCTION Function to test and a potential ISAfunction  of Lab1 TMAL02 course.
%   Tests the pressure, temperature, speed of sound, density and speed of
%   sound values implemented according to the US Standard Atmosphere
%   definition.
%
%   Input required by CHECKISAFUNCTION is:
%   fileName      :(optional) file name. May be left empty (called without
%                  input argument if the function has the name
%                  "ISAfunction" and is on the Matlab path).
%   fileDirectory :(optional) file path / directory
%
%   Output calculated for the International Standard Atmosphere are: 
%  none         : prints user feedback to thew command window only
%
% Dependencies: Requires the (external) cprintf function by Moir Altman. See 
% https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24093-cprintf-display-formatted-colored-text-in-the-command-wind

The function is protected (thus a .p file instead a .m file) because it contains the solution of the lab1 as the reference to be compared to your function.
